# `fixtures/symbol_server/`

Microsoft operates a [public symbol server](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/debugger/microsoft-public-symbols). The files are large and owned by Microsoft, so we do not host them in this repository.

Before running tests, please run `scripts/download` from the project root folder (where Cargo.lock is located) to seed the files.
